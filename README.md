# lasting
🎵 lastfm stats, cached, and in rust

# ❓ how to use
just go to the path of the user you want to get the pinned repos for! e.g.
```
https://last.thrzl.xyz/thrzl
```

# 💾 installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/terabyte3/pinned
$ cd pinned
$ cargo run
```

# 📚 why
i was annoyed with the speed of the lastfm api, so i decided to cache the results (to also avoid hitting ratelimits)

# how to contribute
1. fork
2. make changes
3. make sure the stuff actually works
4. pull request 👍🏽
